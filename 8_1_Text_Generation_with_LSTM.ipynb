        "## 8.1.2 How do you generate sequence data\n",
        "\n",
        "The universal way to generate sequence data in deep learning is to train a network (RNN or convnet most of the times) to predict the next token or next few tokens in a sequence, using the previous token as input. Tokens are usually words or characters, and a model than can model this probability is called a *language model*. This languge model captures the *latent space* of language: its statistical structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have a trained language model, you can sample from it: you feed it an initial string of text (conditioning data), ask it to generate the next character (or word), add the generated output back to the input data, and repeat the process. The output of such a model will be a softmax over all possible characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8.1.3 The importance of the sampling strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "When generating text, the way you choose the next character is cruacially important. One approach is the *greedy sampling*, which chooses the most likely next character. This approach results in repetitive, predictable strings that don't look like coherent language. \n",
        "\n",
        "A more interesting approach is to introduce randomness in the sampling process, that is, sampling from the probability distribution for the next character. This is called *stochastic sampling*\n",
        "\n",
        "Sampling from this probability distribution introduces unlikely characters to be sampled some of the time, generating interesting sentences. But you can not *control the amount of randomness* in the sampling process, and that is a knob you would like to have. \n",
        "\n",
        "To control the amount of randomness in the sampling process, a parameter called *softmax temperature* was introduced. This parameter characterizes the entropy of the probability distribution used for sampling. Given a `temperature` value, a new probability distribution is computed from the original softmax one, by reweighting it in the following way:\n",

        "  distribution = np.log(original_distribution) / temperature\n",
